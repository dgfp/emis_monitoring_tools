    <h4>About the release:</h4>
    <p>FPI eSupervision System version 2.3 is the modified version of 2.1 containing fixes for some issues as well as
        some enhancements.</p>
    <h4>Issues fixed: </h4>
    <ol>
        <ol>
            <li>Issues with work plan submission status (resubmitted and submitted) by FWA have been fixed.</li>
            <li>Appropriate color has been assigned to different status of work plan submission by FWAs (with regard to
                changes made by the FWA subsequent to submission). Validation also added so that FWAs can make changes
                to the submitted work plan only after getting input from FPI. In other words, FWAs would not be able to
                re-submit their work plan before getting FPI&rsquo;s feedback.</li>
            <li>Validation included in the field for inputting number of days on leave (only one digit is acceptable,
                which was unlimited in previous version).</li>
            <li>Text input field for EPI activities has been added in FWA e-register and correspondingly, FPI can now
                select EPI activities for monitoring purposes based on the selection made by the FWA in her work plan.
            </li>
            <li>Problems with multiple windows popping up due to repetitive presses in work plan items have been solved.
            </li>
            <li>An FPI can now select multiple FWAs while adding item in his/her work plan. Earlier, the FPI was able to
                select one FWA only. (পরিবার কল্যাণ সহকারীর অগ্রিম কর্মসূচি যাচাই ও অনুমোদন করা)</li>
            <li>Issues with workplan item: FWA activity visit; has been solved.(পরিবার কল্যাণ সহকারীর কার্যক্রম

            <li>FPI would be able to add &ldquo;community clinic visit&rdquo; without particular name of the community
                clinic (FPIs were facing problem in adding community clinic visits in the catchment area, as the list of
                community clinics were not showing in the list).</li>
            <li>Issues with Data sync has been fixed (in some cases it was getting halted at 1%).</li>
            <li>During work plan submission, sometimes raw codes became visible, which has been solved.</li>
            <li>FPI is now able to generate reports for multiple unions (with additional charge) from
                Tab<strong>.</strong></li>
            <li>Mandatory approval of work plans within 3 days&rsquo; of submission has been removed or it could be
                approved later than that.</li>
        </ol>
